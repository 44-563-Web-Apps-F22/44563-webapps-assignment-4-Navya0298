            <h4>The Yeoman of the Guard </h4>
            <h5>Act 1 - When maiden loves, she sits and sighs</h5>
            <p> 

               <p> WILFRED.  Mistress Meryll!. </p>
              
               <p> PHOEBE.   [looking up] Eh! Oh! it's you, is it? You may go
                          away,if you like. Because I don't want you, you know.</p>
              
                          <p>  WILFRED.  Haven't you anything to say to me?.</p>
              
                            <p> PHOEBE.    Oh yes! Are the birds all caged? The wild beasts all
                          littered down? All the locks, chains, bolts, and bars
                          in good order? Is the Little Ease sufficiently
                          comfortable? The racks, pincers, and thumbscrews all
                          ready for work? Ugh! you brute!.</p>
              
                          <p> WILFRED.   These allusions to my professional duties are in
                          doubtful taste. I didn't become a head-jailer because
                          I like head-jailing. I didn't become an assistant-
                          tormentor because I like assistant-tormenting. We
                          can't all be sorcerers, you know. [PHOEBE is annoyed]
                          Ah! you brought that upon yourself.</p>
              
                          <p>  PHOEBE.   Colonel Fairfax is not a sorcerer. He's a man of
                          science and an alchemist.</p>
              
                          <p>   WILFRED.  Well, whatever he is, he won't be one for long, for
                          he's to be beheaded to-day for dealings with the
                          devil. His master nearly had him last night, when the
                          fire broke out in the Beauchamp [pronounced Bee'cham]
                          Tower.</p>
              
                          <p>  PHOEBE.    Oh! how I wish he had escaped in the confusion! But
                          take care; there's still time for a reply to his
                          petition for mercy.</p>
              
                          <p>   WILFRED.   Ah! I'm content to chance that. This evening at half-
                          past sevenâ€” ah! [Gesture of chopping off a head.]</p>
              
                          <p>  PHOEBE.    You're a cruel monster to speak so unfeelingly of the
                          death of a young and handsome soldier.</p>
              
                          <p>  WILFRED.  Young and handsome! How do you know he's young and
                          handsome?</p>
              
                          <p>  PHOEBE.   Because I've seen him every day for weeks past taking
                          his exercise on the Beauchamp [pronounced Bee'cham]
                          Tower.</p>
              
                          <p> WILFRED.  Curse him!</p>
