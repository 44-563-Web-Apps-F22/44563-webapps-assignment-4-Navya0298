                <h6 class="YEOMAN">.YEOMAN</h6> <p class="speech">  Good day, Dame Carruthers. Busy to-day?</p>

                <h6 class="DAME">.DAME</h6> <p class="speech">Busy, aye! the fire in the Beauchamp <p class="direction"> [pronounced
        Bee'cham]</p> last night has given me work enough. A dozen
        poor prisoners— Richard Colfax, Sir Martin Byfleet,
        Colonel Fairfax, Warren the preacher-poet, and half-a-
        score others— all packed into one small cell, not six
        feet square. Poor Colonel Fairfax, who's to die to-
        day, is to be removed to no. 14 in the Cold Harbour
        that <p class="direction"> [he may have his last hour alone with his
        confessor;]</p> and I've to see to that.</p>


        <h6 class="YEOMAN">.YEOMAN</h6> <p class="speech"> Poor gentleman! He'll die bravely. I fought under him
        two years since, and he valued his life as it were a
        feather!</p>

        <h6 class="PHOEBE">.PHOEBE</h6> <p class="speech">He's the bravest, the handsomest, and the best young
        gentleman in England! He twice saved my father's life;
        and it's a cruel thing, a wicked thing, and a
        barbarous thing that so gallant a hero should lose his
        head— for it's the handsomest head in England!</p>

        <h6 class="DAME">.DAME</h6> <p class="speech"> For dealings with the devil. Aye! if all were beheaded
        who dealt with him, <p class="direction">[there'd be busy things on Tower]</p>
        Green.</p>

        <h6 class="PHOEBE">.PHOEBE</h6> <p class="speech">You know very well that Colonel Fairfax is a student
        of alchemy— nothing m>ore, and nothing less; but this
        wicked Tower, like a cruel giant in a fairy-tale, must
        be fed with blood, and that blood must be the best and
        bravest in England, or it's not good enough for the
        old Blunderbore. Ugh!</p>

        <h6 class="DAME">.DAME</h6> <p class="speech">Silence, you silly girl; you know not what you say. I
        was born in the old keep, and I've grown grey in it,
        and, please God, I shall die and be buried in it; and
        there's not a stone in its walls that is not as dear
        tome as my right hand.</p>
